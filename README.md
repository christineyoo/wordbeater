# Word Beater App

This is my first upload on GitHub. To practice, I downloaded some sample files for a "Pizza" website and uploaded them here.

## Project Description

Given a random word and time limit, the user must accurately type the word in the time given to earn points. If the user is unable to type the exact word in the given time, the score is reset to zero and the user can try again by typing the next provided word.

This project was first built by following Traversy Media's YouTube tutorial, and I added two new features: a drop-down menu to select the level and a "Try Again" button to reset the game. These extra features were added using query selectors, event listeners, and DOM manipulation.
